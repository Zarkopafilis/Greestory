# Greestory

Guy told me to make this app , he showed a mock app , I made it a reality.
He decided to mess around with the sources and change some code and move the server (= changing IP) without telling me.
The app broke apart and I tried to fix it...again....

It's up on playstore + we came 2nd in a contest.
